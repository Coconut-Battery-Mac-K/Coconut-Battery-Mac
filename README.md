## Overview

<a href="#">Coconut Battery for macOS</a> delivers professional-grade battery monitoring through an interface designed for both simplicity and depth. The application serves MacBook users, iOS device owners, and IT professionals who need genuine insight into battery condition rather than simplified status indicators.

The <a href="#">real-time monitoring</a> dashboard presents essential battery metrics at a glance while providing drill-down access to detailed information. Watch charge levels, track power draw, and monitor temperature without navigating away from the main view.

<a href="#">Power consumption analysis</a> reveals how much energy your system draws under various conditions. Understand which activities drain battery fastest and optimize usage patterns for longer runtime when away from power sources.

<a href="#">Temperature monitoring</a> tracks battery temperature which significantly affects both immediate performance and long-term health. High temperatures accelerate degradation, so awareness enables protective behavior during demanding tasks.

The <a href="#">charge status details</a> go beyond percentage to show actual milliamp-hour values, charging rate, and time estimates based on current consumption. Professional-grade measurements provide the complete picture needed for serious battery management.

<a href="#">Comparison tools</a> show how your battery's current capacity compares to original design specifications. Clear visual indicators communicate health status instantly while detailed numbers satisfy technical users wanting precise measurements.

<a href="#">Device history</a> maintains records across multiple devices for users managing several Macs or iOS devices. Track the health of an entire fleet from a single interface without losing historical data when switching between machines.

The <a href="#">notification system</a> alerts you to significant battery events including capacity milestones and potential issues. Proactive warnings about declining health enable timely decisions about battery replacement.

<a href="#">Export functionality</a> generates reports suitable for documentation, warranty claims, or resale preparation. Having verifiable battery health records adds value when selling used equipment and supports service requests.

<a href="#">Regular updates</a> maintain compatibility with new Mac models and macOS releases. As Apple introduces new battery technologies and system changes, Coconut Battery adapts to continue providing accurate monitoring.

<a href="#">Minimal resource usage</a> ensures battery monitoring doesn't itself drain significant power. The lightweight background process provides continuous monitoring without measurable impact on runtime.
